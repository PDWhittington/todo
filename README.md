# todo &mdash; an idiosyncratic todo list manager

This project is a small C# solution which manages todo lists written in Markdown.

Over the next couple of weeks, I will flesh out this Readme file with a description of how it should be used and a full list of features.

In the meantime, build the app and run `todo help` from the command line to see a full list of commands.

Please feel free to DM me on Twitter, [@PDWhittington](https://twitter.com/PDWhittington), or to add issues for any features you would like to see.

Thanks,

Phil Whittington
